### Selective waste sorting with open-source robots 

I'm currently working on a personal project to perform selective waste sorting with either a manipulator arm (SO-101) or a mobile robot (Le Kiwi).

### Optimal control (MPC) on robot Franka Emika Panda

During my time at LAAS-CNRS, I developed in a team of 7 engineers and PhD students a library for optimal control. We tuned and experimentally validated the library controller for several demos that involved trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and visual servoing.

Different videos of these demos are available.
