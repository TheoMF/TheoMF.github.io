# About me

I'm a Robotics Engineer graduated from Centrale Nantes. I have recently completed a two-year position as a Research Engineer at LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse in the [Gepetto Team](https://www.laas.fr/fr/equipes/gepetto/). There, I contributed to the development of a ROS2/Python optimal control (MPC) library for the European project [agimus](https://www.agimus-project.eu/) under the supervision of [Nicolas Mansard](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/index.php/Members/NicolasMansard).

I'm specialized in software and control. I'm interested in innovative systems from Industry 4.0 such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. I previously worked with manipulator arms and mobile robots.
